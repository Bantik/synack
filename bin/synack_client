Hi! It looks like you're trying to connect to a Synack server, which is great,
but you didn't specify a URI.

Try this instead:

    synack_client 127.0.0.1:11113

You'll probably have better luck that way.
}

if ARGV.empty?
  puts USAGE
  exit
end

host, port = ARGV.first.split(/:/)

begin
  client = Synack::Client.new host: host, port: (port || 11113)

  while true
    print "~> "
    _input = STDIN.gets.chomp
    exit if _input == '/quit'
    client.say _input
  end
rescue DRb::DRbConnError => e
  puts "Some kind of connection error occurred: #{e}"
end
